Build a single-page web app (one page only) that lets a user upload an image and runs our YOLOv8 license-plate detection model on it, then displays the detection results with a confidence meter.

Requirements

UI (one page)

Title: “Saudi ANPR – License Plate Detector”

A file upload control that accepts: .jpg .jpeg .png .webp

A “Detect Plates” button

A results section that shows:

The original uploaded image

The image with bounding boxes drawn around detected plates

A list of detections with:

detection index (Plate #1, Plate #2, …)

confidence score (0–1 or %)

a confidence meter (progress bar)

Show a “No plates detected” message if none found.

Show a loading state while inference runs.

Handle errors (invalid file, server error, etc.).

Backend API
Use Python + FastAPI (preferred) or Flask.

Endpoint: POST /detect

Accept image upload (multipart/form-data)

Run YOLOv8 inference using Ultralytics

Return JSON:

{
  "detections": [
    {"bbox":[x1,y1,x2,y2], "conf":0.93}
  ],
  "image_annotated_base64": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
}


bbox must be in pixel coordinates (x1,y1,x2,y2).

If possible also return image width/height.

Model loading

Load model once at startup:

weights path: ./weights/best.pt (configurable)

Device: use GPU if available, otherwise CPU.

Confidence threshold: configurable (default 0.25).

Support multiple detections.

Frontend
Use plain HTML/CSS/JS or React (your choice). Keep it simple.

On upload, preview image.

On click “Detect Plates”, send file to backend /detect.

Render annotated image and detection list with confidence bars.

Future feature placeholder
Add a UI toggle (disabled for now) labeled:

“Blur plate numbers (coming soon)”
Also include a comment in code showing where the blur logic will be added later.

Deliverables

Provide complete code for:

backend/ (FastAPI app, requirements.txt)

frontend/ (single-page app)

Include run instructions:

how to install dependencies

how to start backend

how to serve frontend

Keep code modular and readable.

Notes

Do not implement OCR in this version.

Focus only on detection + confidence visualization.

Use bounding boxes + confidence meter as the core demo.
