# RealTime-Object-Detection-CV2025

This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system
as part of the **EMAI651 – Computer Vision** course.

## Project Overview
- License plate detection using **YOLOv8**
- Base training on a large generic plate dataset
- Fine-tuning on **Saudi license plates**
- OCR applied to detected plates with confidence scores
- Visual results and evaluation included

## Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics, PyTorch)
- OpenCV
- EasyOCR
- Google Colab

## Results (Detection)
- mAP@0.50: **0.9458**
- Recall: **0.9471**
